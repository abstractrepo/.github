# AbstractRepo
 > an opinionated monorepo for production

# Usage
  ```bash
    # note: `@abstractrepo/bin` is still planing phrase
    npx @abstractrepo/bin init
  ```

# Todo
 - [ ] still find command package
 - [ ] project config
 - [ ] plugin config
 - [ ] template config
 - [ ] root config
 - [ ] kernel that using root to show all command that register
 - [ ] can create plugin register commands
 - [ ] can create plugin register other runtimes like `node`, `php`, `go`, `rust`, ...etc.
 - [ ] can create plugin register templates
 - [ ] can create plugin as sets (runtimes, templates, commands)

## why another monorepo?
 > well the popular monorepo like nx just too complecated for me and turborepo just cannot customize command
